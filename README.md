# Technical test
Project developed for technical evaluation.

## The objective of this project version
Backend application developed for practical purposes using **Clean aArchitecture + object-oriented programming paradigm + SOLID principles.** This application is a CRUD developed with **Node.js + TypeScript** without using frameworks with everything pre-built, such as **Nest.js** or **Adonis.js.**

## Tutorial
**Note:** To follow the step-by-step instructions for running the application on your machine, you need to have knowledge of terminal commands, Git and GitHub commands, and npm package manager commands, as well as navigating between folders using the terminal.

### Cloning and setting up the project
**1º step: clone the repository to your machine from GitHub.**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marlinsk/tmaior-test-marlon.git
```

**2º step: Navigate to the project folder.**
```bash
cd tmaior-test-marlon
```

**3º step: Run the command in the terminal to install the project dependencies.**
```bash
npm install
```

**4º step: Execute the command to build the application.**
```bash
npm run build
```
Without the **dist file** generated by the build, the application will not work.

**5º step: Run the command in the terminal to start the application, and feel free to test and play around.**
```bash
npm run start
```

Now, you just need to access it using a request tool or consume it; the application is running on localhost:5000.

## Creating a Docker image of the application
**Note**: You need to have Docker on your machine and have a basic understanding of terminal commands. Having all of that, let's get started.

**1º step: Inside the project folder, run the following command in the terminal to create the Docker image.**
```bash
docker build -t <IMAGE NAME>:0.1 .
```

**2º step: Run the command in the terminal for list your images**
```bash
docker images
```
After that, look for the **IMAGE ID** of your image name and copy it.

**3º step: With the IMAGE ID of your Docker image copied, use it in the following command.**
```bash
docker run <IMAGE ID>
```
Now, you have an application running in a Docker container. You just need to access it using a request tool or consume it; the application is running on localhost:5000

### Other docker commands
Command to list the running containers
```bash
docker ps
```

To stop a specific container
```bash
docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
```
To stop all running containers, you can simply use **docker stop.**

To remove specific container
```bash
docker rm <CONTAINER ID>
```

To remove specific image
```bash
docker rmi <IMAGE ID>
```
